# 6. Digital representation
By now, we have all the ingredients needed to solve the Ostomachion puzzle, so it's time to start thinking about actually coding it. On the one hand, I want to extract as much performance out of the code as I can, so the inner performance-critical parts of the code will make extensive use of templates, raw pointers and data structures which optimize memory transfer. These are things like the arithmetic operations, polygon copy and polygon overlap. On the other hand, I want to make good use of abstraction to make the code easier to read and maintain, so the non-performance-critical sections of the code will use constructs like inheritance, factories and smart pointers. I also want to support several ways to do the same thing, so I can compare the performance. Finally, I want to benchmark the whole thing.

First, we need a data type that codifies the numbers needed for all the operations. We saw in the previous post that we can use algebraic numbers or floating point numbers. Let's call this the `Number` class and require it to support <b>addition</b>, <b>subtraction</b>, <b>multiplication</b> and <b>comparison</b>. In the case of floats, comparison is done up to a tolerance which is defined in compile time.

Second, we define the `Angle` class, which contains the `Number`s cosine and sine, and supports addition and subtraction;

```c++
template <typename Number>
struct Angle {
    Number cos, sin;
    Angle& operator+(const Angle& other_angle);
    Angle& operator-(const Angle& other_angle);
};
```

Third, we need to codify the polygon and its vertices. Because of the Merge and Prune algorithm that we want to use for combining polygons, vertices need to be often updated, added and removed from arbitrary sections of the polygon, so it makes sense to implement the polygon as a circular doubly-linked list of vertices. Let's define the templated `Vertex` class which receives a `Number` as a template argument and supports translation and rotation.

```c++
template <typename Number>
struct Vertex {
    Number x, y; // position of the vertex
    Vertex *next, *previous; // doubly-linked list pointers
    Angle<Number> start, end, opening; // angles
    void translate(const Number& dx, const Number& dy);
    void rotate(const Angle& angle);
};
```
The `Polygon` class contains an overlap method as discussed in a previous post.
```c++
template <typename Number>
struct Polygon {
    Vertex<Number> *head; // head of the circular linked list
    void translate(const Number& dx, const Number& dy);
    void rotate(const Angle& angle);
    bool overlaps(const Polygon& polygon);
};
```

Fourth, we need a container `State` to codify a configuration of polygons and provide a way to find configurations branching out from this one. It needs to contain the following information: the current frame polygon, which polygons are left to insert and the location of currently-inserted polygons (so that the state can be correctly visualized later). I decided to template it with `Polygon` instead of `Number` because at this level of abstraction, we will not need to think about the numbers at all. It contains all the information required to find all the next valid states that branch out from this one, so it also implements a `find_next_states()` method. Additionally, it also implements a `selector` method which selects one `Vertex` (by its index) from the `Polygon` to serve as an anchor vertex, as discussed before.

```c++
template <typename Polygon>
struct State {
    Polygon frame;
    std::vector<Polygon> missing;
    std::vector<Polygon> inserted;
    std::vector<State> find_next_states();
    std::function<unsigned int(Polygon)> selector;
};
```

Fifth, we have to define the puzzle, that is, define the polygons that should be included, and what the initial frame looks like. Additionally, we can also use this step to provide information on the manipulations that we want to allow for each polygon. For example, we might decide that the polygons cannot be flipped, what vertices can be used as probing vertices, etc. Let's codify all of this in a `RestrictedPolygon` class, which contains information about the allowed transformations, the amount of identical polygons and the polygon itself. The `PolySet` class is then a set of `RestrictedPolygon`s and a frame. This class is general enough to let us solve any similar puzzle, not just the Ostomachion!

```c++
template <typename Polygon>
struct RestrictedPolygon {
    Polygon polygon;
    unsigned int amount;
    enum transformations {Flip, Rotate, FlipRotate, None};
};

template <typename Polygon>
struct PolySet {
    std::vector<RestrictedPolygon<Polygon>> polygons;
    Polygon initial_frame;
};
```

Sixth, the puzzle is going to be solved via traversal of a graph, so we need to encode that somehow. As we've seen in a previous post, the graph is in general an acyclic directed graph, since there may be several different ways to reach any state from a previous state. We want to avoid repeating any calculations, so we need to keep track of which nodes (`State`s) have already been computed. Then, we can use a hash table to keep track of the previously-computed nodes and a stack of nodes we want to visit. Each time that a node is visited, if the node wasn't already computed, we run the `find_next_states()` on this node and put the resulting `State`s back on the stack. All of this logic can be done internally and abstracted away in a `Container` class, which only exposes methods to insert and remove a shared pointer to a `State`.
```c++
template <typename State>
struct Container {
    std::unsorted_set<std::shared_ptr<State>> hash_map;
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<State>> stack;
    std::shared_ptr<State> get();
    void insert(std::shared_ptr<State> state);
};

```
 When a node is inserted, it's checked against the hash table. If it already exists, then this operation does nothing. If it does not exist, it is added to the hash table and the stack. The `get` method returns an element from the stack.

## Solving the puzzle
All of the previous ingredients now come together to solve the puzzle:

1. Initialize the `missing` and `frame` fields in `State` from the Ostomachion `PolySet`.
2. Insert this `State` into a `Container`.
3. Get a `State` from the `Container`, run `find_next_states()` and insert them all back into the `Container`.
4. Repeat step 3 until the `get` operation yields no more states. 
5. Iterate over the hash table in the `Container` and check which `States` have no missing polygons.

This is indeed all we need to do to solve the puzzle, and if your computer had a few petabytes of RAM lying around, it would work. Unfortunately, the search graph is just too large. Keeping a hash table with <b>all</b> the `State`s is just unfeasible, especially considering that only a tiny portion of those are valid final states. The next sections are about optimizing every step of this process as much as possible.
