# 5. Mathematical representation

So far, we realized that the Ostomachion can be solved by translating and rotating polygons around. Next, we need to to figure out a way to represent them in code. We could just use a floating-point representation for the angles and coordinates, but I'd like to use this section to explore a different approach: <b>can we do this in a mathematically exact way in code</b>?

There are three main things we need to ensure: 
- <b>angles</b> representing the angle the edges make with the x axis and the opening angle between edges. They need to support angle addition and subtraction
- <b>vectors</b> representing the locations of the polygon's vertices. These need to support vector addition, dot product and rotation by an angle
- we need to be able to <b>compare</b> these vectors and angles to determine polygon overlap

For practical purposes, we only ever need the sine and cosine of the angle, because that's what's required for rotations. Rotation of a vector by an angle then consists of a simple set of products and additions, no need to calculate trigonometric functions. Let's then represent the angle by a unit vector whose coordinates are $\left(\cos, \sin\right)$, or alternatively, as a complex number $z=\cos + i\sin$. Likewise, the vectors are simply represented by their coordinates $\left(x, y\right)$, or alternatively, as the complex number $z=x+i y$. Complex numbers are a really good fit for this problem because they encapsulate the idea of rotation and translation very naturally within their structure:
- Vector addition becomes complex number addition
- Rotation of a vector by an angle becomes complex number multiplication

## Complex algebraic numbers
What type of number should we use for the complex number components? If we want mathematical exactness, floating point numbers are right out. Looking at the Ostomachion puzzle pieces, they have one very important property: all their vertices lie on integer coordinates! Analyzing the angles that the edges make with the $x$ axis, each edge can be seen as the hypotenuse of a right triangle with integer legs, which means that <b>all</b> of the sines and cosines in the image are of the form 

$$\frac{a}{b}\sqrt{c}$$

where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are all integers. This can be used as the basis for our numeric system. 

First, let's notice that this representation can be made unique by requiring that $c$ be expressable as a product of non-repeated primes, that is, the square root cannot be further simplified. Second, suppose we start with a vector of integer coordinates $z=x+iy$ and rotate it by an angle represented by $w=\frac{a}{b}\sqrt{c}+i\frac{d}{e}\sqrt{f}$. Then, the new point will be 
$$z^\prime = zw=\left(x \frac{a}{b}\sqrt{c} - y\frac{d}{e}\sqrt{f}\right) + i\left(y \frac{a}{b}\sqrt{c} + x\frac{d}{e}\sqrt{f}\right)$$

As the vectors get translated and rotated, their components will pick up more and more radicals, and some radicals will combine with others. We can already see that a general representation of a number in this numeric system will be composed of a sum of many fractions multiplied by square roots:

$$ x = \sum_i \frac{a_i}{b_i}\sqrt{c_i}$$

What square roots should be included exactly? To answer this, we need to iterate over all puzzle pieces, compute their sines and cosines and see what is inside the square root after simplification. Surprisingly, only four different square roots appear: $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{5}$, $\sqrt{13}$ and $\sqrt{17}$. This means that $\sqrt{c_i}$ can only assume $2^4$ different values, consisting of all possible combinations of products of these square roots and $\sqrt{1}$. Here are some examples

$$ 1 + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2}$$
$$ \frac{4}{3} $$
$$ -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{5} + 4\sqrt{65} $$
$$ -2 -\frac{3}{7}\sqrt{10} - \frac{1}{10}\sqrt{17} + \frac{9}{5}\sqrt{221} $$

These kinds of numbers are a type of <b>algebraic numbers</b> and are closed under the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. They are represented as $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{13}, \sqrt{17}]$.

## Comparing algebraic numbers
Being able to compare two numbers is a basic essential operation to determine polygon overlap. We all know how to do it for real and rational numbers, but algebraic numbers pose a challenge because we cannot approximate the square roots. Without loss of generality, let's assume we want to know whether an algebraic number $x \gt 0$. How do we determine whether that sum evaluates to a positive or a negative number?

To answer this, it helps to begin with a simpler example, the set of algebraic numbers that only contains $\sqrt{2}$, that is numbers $x\in\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]$ of the form $a+b\sqrt{2}$ where $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$ are rational numbers. We can determine how $x$ relates to $0$ by doing the following checks:
- $x$ is zero only if both $a$ and $b$ are zero
- if any of $a$ and $b$ are zero, the sign is the same as the non-zero fractional number. 
- if $a$ and $b$ are both positive, then $x$ is positive
- if $a$ and $b$ are both negative, then $x$ is negative
- if $a\gt0$ and $b\lt0$, then $(a+b\sqrt{2})(a-b\sqrt{2})$ has the same sign as $x$, but evaluates to the simpler rational expression $a^2 - 2b^2$ which we know how to evaluate
- similarly, if $a\lt0$ and $b\gt0$, $x$ has the same sign as $2b^2 - a^2$

So, the trick to finding the sign of this simple algebraic number lies in using its conjugate to convert it into a rational number that we know how to evaluate. Repeating this process recursively will allows us to estimate the sign of an algebraic number with an arbitrary number of radicals. 

Consider now $x\in \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{5}]$ of the form 

$$x = a + b\sqrt{2} + c\sqrt{5} + d\sqrt{10}$$ 

where $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ are rational numbers. $x$ can also be expressed as

$$ x = A + B\sqrt{5} $$

where $A = a + b\sqrt{2}$ and $B = c + d\sqrt{2} $ are simpler algebraic numbers that only contain $\sqrt{2}$. To get the sign of $x$, we just need to do the same checks as before on $A$ and $B$, keeping in mind that each of those will also require individual checks because they themselves are algebraic numbers. This establishes a recursive chain that stops when we reach a rational number and is easily generalizeable to the case we are actually interested in.

Now that we know how to deal with algebraic numbers, we can forget about their structure and just keep in mind that we know how to add, multiply and compare them.

## Adding and comparing angles
Angle addition is done via trigonometric rules (or equivalently via complex number multiplication)

$$ \cos(\alpha+\beta) = \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) $$ 
$$ \sin(\alpha+\beta) = \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) $$

which only requires knowledge of the other angles' sines and cosines. Now, how do we compare angles when all we know is their trigonometric components? We begin by interpeting the components $\cos(\alpha), \sin(\alpha)$ as an angle with the $x$ axis. Then, if both sines are positive, the larger angle is the one with the smaller cosine, and if both sines are negative, the larger angle is the one with the larger cosine. If the sines have different signs, the angle with negative sine is larger.

## Arbitrary precision integers
The only thing missing now is how to deal with the fractions. We could just use integers to represent these fractions and call it a day, but when we get down to actually programming it, we run into a problem: in many programming languages, regular integers just aren't large enough to store all the information we need. This becomes especially noticeable when we try to determine if an algebraic number is positive because of the process of squaring the integers. In our case, this generally needs to be done four times, yielding potentially very large integers that languages such as C++ cannot represent normally. The solution is to use a library that provides arbitrary precision integers, like GMP. Python already does this from the get-go.

## Summary and shortcomings
In principle, we now have all the mathematical structure required to solve our problem. This is what we learned so far:
1. A complex number structure is a natural way to represent the operations we want to support: translation and rotation. 
2. Algebraic numbers allow us to implement this complex number structure in a way that exactly represents polygons of integer coordinates.
3. Arbitrary precision integers enable the fractions in the algebraic numbers to be represented in code in a mathematically exact way.

In my opinion this is a beautiful and satisfying way to approach the puzzle, and it's why I decided to explore it (and implement it), but it has one significant flaw. It is slow. Painfully slow. It's $200$ times slower than using floating-point numbers, so if we want to solve this puzzle in any decent amount of time we will have to sacrifice some mathematical exactness for speed. In the interest of curiosity, my current implementation of the code supports both floating-point numbers and algebraic numbers via template arguments.
